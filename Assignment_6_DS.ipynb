    "Q.1. What are escape characters, and how do you use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Escape characters are characters that are used to represent certain elements that cannot be      input into a string or program directly. They are usually preceded by a backslash () and are      used to represent things like newlines, tabs, and quotation marks. For example, the escape        character for a newline is '\\n', and the escape character for a tab is '\\t'. To use an            escape character in a string, you simply need to include the backslash followed by the            appropriate character in the string.\n"
